# reveal.js 3.8.0 template for presentation assistant.

This is a copy of the [RevealJS](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) repository with the Javascript code included for convenience. If you want to use a more recent version of RevealJS, simply take the Javascript code responsible to open a websocket and put it in a more recent version of RevealJS. If the API is not broken, it should work out of the box.
